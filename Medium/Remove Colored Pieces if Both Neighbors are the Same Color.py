# Problem:

# There are n pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by 'A' or by 'B'. You are given a string colors of length n where colors[i] is the color of the ith piece.

# Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves first.

# Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors are also colored 'A'. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'B'.
# Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'B' if both its neighbors are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'A'.
# Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
# If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.
# Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins, or return false if Bob wins.


# Example 1:

# Input: colors = "AAABABB"
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# AAABABB -> AABABB
# Alice moves first.
# She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

# Now it's Bob's turn.
# Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
# Thus, Alice wins, so return true.

# Solution:

class Solution:
    def winnerOfGame(self, colors: str) -> bool:
        a, b = 0, 0 

        for i in range(1, len(colors) - 1):
            if colors[i - 1] == colors[i] == colors[i + 1]:
                if colors[i] == 'A':
                    a += 1
                else:
                    b += 1
        
        return a > b
