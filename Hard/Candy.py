# Problem:
# There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

# You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

# Each child must have at least one candy.
# Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
# Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

# Example :

# Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

# Solution:

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        res = [1] * len(ratings)

        for i in range(1,len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + 1
            
        for i in range(len(ratings) - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] and res[i] <= res[i + 1]:
                res[i] = res[i + 1] + 1

        return sum(res)
